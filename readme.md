# Bullshit Interview Questions

You know how, when you interview for a programming job, you get asked a bunch of
little "quiz" questions that have _absolutely **nothing** to do with the job?_
I'm pretty sick of that, so from now on, and as the mood strikes me, I'm going
to create samples/examples of such "bullshit" questions and how to solve them.

And no, in the interest of not making myself an unhireable pariah, I will _not_
be naming and shaming the companies and interviewers who ask such questions.

_(Even though sometimes I really want to.)_

> Your implementation of X is sloppy (or needs work or could be better or...)

I don't much care since these questions are all literally bullshit and have
nothing to do with the job of building, shipping and supporting real server-side
application software in the real world. There's no (profitable) "FizzBuzz" app
anywhere, so who cares?
